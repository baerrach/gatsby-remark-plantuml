# Install node dependencies #

Installing the node depedencies only needs to be done once, and then again if
they change.

```bash
npm install
```

# How to run the tests #

```bash
npm t
```

See [How to write tests](#how-to-write-tests) for further details.

# How to visualize the tests #

To visually inspect the results of the tests you can open the svg generated by
the tests in a browser. The visualization writes the files into
`./svg/<test-name>.html`.

```
npm v
```

# How to release #

We use [standard-release](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#readme) to manage the release process.

While we are still in beta phase need to manually specify release version to increment `y` as the default is to increment `z` when `x === 0`.

```
npm run release -- --release-as 0.Y.0
```

This will automatically update the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

# How to publish to npm repository #

Only the owner of the npm package can [publish to the npm repository](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-unscoped-public-packages).

```bash
npm login
npm publish
```

# How to obtain souce code #

Follow the advice from [Cloning a repository from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github)

The repository is located at https://github.com/baerrach/gatsby-remark-plantuml.git

# How to write tests #

The tests are built with [jest](https://jestjs.io).

All test files are located in `test/`

* `test/index.spec.js` tests the plugin usage
* `test/errors.spec.js` tests error handling
* `test/max-width.spec.js` tests the `max-width` feature
* `test/sequence.spec.js` tests the `sequence` diagram capabilities
* `test/use-case.spec.js` tests the `use-case` diagram capabilities

All snapshots are located in `test/__snapshots__/<test-file-name>.js.snap` and
for each test block will contain a string for the snapshotted output. Reading
the snapshot output can be a bit tricky, the most important bit is the `value`
key which will contain the generated svg.

```
export[`test name`] = `
Object {
  "children": Array [
    Object {
      ...,
      "value": "<svg ...
```

Manually reading the svg contents is also tricky, it is better to [visualize the tests](#how-to-visualize-the-tests) and open the resulting file in the browser
and check out the svg there.

## General boiler plate for a test file ##

```
// <Description of tests purpose>

const testRemarkPlugin = require(`./test-remark-plugin`)

describe(`<Describe block for test group>`, () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.resetModules()
  })

  it(`<Single test name>`, async () => {
    const code = `
\`\`\`plantuml
@startuml
<Plant UML code to be tested>
@enduml
\`\`\`
`

    await testRemarkPlugin.testPlugin({
      code,
    })
  })
})
```

The `testRemarkPlugin` provides helpers to do all the heavy lifting in the
tests.

The `beforeEach` block is necessary to reset the jest mocking before tests are
run.

The code is tested via the `.testPlugin` call:

```
    await testRemarkPlugin.testPlugin({
      code,
    })
```

The `testPlugin` takes the provided code and makes use of [snapshot
testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing) to compare the generated
svg with the snapshot version. It is important that you [visualize your
test](http://localhost:6419/#how-to-visualize-the-tests) to ensure it is correct
before commiting the test snapshot.

Fill in the `<blanks>` as described below.

### Description of tests purpose ###

Include the purpose of the test as a comment at the top of the file.

If this is from the <https://plantuml.com/> examples then include a link.

### Describe block for test group ###

Give a meaningful grouping of the contained tests.

If this is from the <https://plantuml.com/> examples then name it after the
heading it is contained within.

### Single test name ###

Give a meaningful name to your test.

If this is from the <https://plantuml.com/> examples then name it after the
example. Multiple examples with the same name will include a counter suffix.

### Plant UML code to be tested ###

Paste, or create yourself, the plantuml code to be tested.

If this is from the <https://plantuml.com/> examples then copy the code from the
example.

## Testing Errors ##

`testRemarkPlugin.testPlugin` accepts another property `reporter` which contains
the expected Gatsby reporter outputs.

Each reporter is passed an ordered array of expected values that the reporter
should have received.

In most cases this will be a single string, the value that should have been written to the reporter.

```
reporter: {
  info: [
    'First message sent to reporter',
    'Second message sent to reporter',
    ...
  ],
```

If an Error is also required then an array is used to contain both the message and the error.

```
reporter: {
  error: [
    ['An error occured', new PlantUmlError('Cause of Error')],
    'More error messages can come afterwards',
  ],
```

When the reporter should not have any output do not specify that key. Only
reporters that are expected to receive a report need to be provided.

**Example shape of reporter**
```
reporter: {
  info: [],
  warn: [],
  error: [],
  panic: [],
  panicOnBuild: [],
}
```
